### Extracting
Extract the **gauntlet-x.x.zip** folder to a location which you will remember.
### Installing
#### Opening up the Extensions page
Open up your browser of choice. Find the "Extensions" page.
On Chrome, this can be found by clicking the three dots in the top right, clicking "More tools", then "Extensions".
#### Enabling developer mode
In the top right, enable "Developer mode".
#### Loading the extension
On the top left of the page, click "Load unpacked".
Select the directory where you extracted Gauntlet to in the "Extracting" step.
## Settings
On the top right of any NationStates page, you should now see a "Gauntlet Settings" button. Click this button
to be brought to the settings page of the extension.
### Keys
This is where you can view the current key assigned to each feature and select a new key for each feature if you wish.
Some keys have an alternate functionality which can be activated by holding **SHIFT +** the key for the feature.

A detailed description of each feature can be found [here](keys.md)
### Miscellaneous
This is where you can set the jump point you will be using. This value is used for selecting where to move puppets
when prepping and the region to move to when using the "Move Back to Jump Point" key.
### Prepping
In this section, you can set the features used for the "Prep" feature.
#### Password
Set the password you use for your switchers.
**This password will only be stored in the extension's storage, it won't be sent anywhere (except for NationStates
servers) it is only used for logging into your switchers.** Each switcher must have the same password.
#### Switchers
This section is where you input the names of the switchers you'd like to include as part of your prepping.
Enter each switcher's name, one per line.
