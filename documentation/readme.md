# Gauntlet Documentation

## Introduction to Gauntlet

Gauntlet is a NationStates tool which binds standard NationStates functionality used for raider/defender gameplay to keys on the keyboard. It has features which make defending easy. It is a successor to the Breeze++ Chrome extension.

A brief outline of the features is below.

## Current Features

### Custom Keybinds

Gauntlet comes with default keybinds which will be familiar to Breeze++ users. However, keybinds can easily be set for a more personalized experience.

### Quick Endorsing/Dossier

It is necessary to endorse other defenders and dossier the raiders quickly during a chase. Gauntlet makes this easy by allowing the user to add a list of nations to endorse or dossier with a keystroke. The user can then cycle through these nations and endorse or dossier them.

### Quick Prepping

Using Gauntlet, it is simple to prep all of your switchers quickly. The process involves loading your switchers into the extension and selecting a switcher to start from which to begin prepping. Afterwards, the user only needs to repeatedly click their “Prep” key until all of their switchers are prepped.

### Breeze++ Features

Gauntlet inherits all or most of the features from its predecessor, Breeze++. These features include standard chasing functionality such as quickly opening up the reports page, dossing, endorsing, and chasing raiders off the report page.
