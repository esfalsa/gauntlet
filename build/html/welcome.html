    <h2>What is Gauntlet?</h2>

    <p>Gauntlet is a browser extension that allows you to set custom keybinds for common actions in defending gameplay.
      For instance, with Gauntlet, you can prep your switchers, move between regions, and refresh your reports with just
      your keyboard.</p>

    <h2>How do I get started?</h2>

    <p>

    </p>

    <p>
      In addition to keybind settings, some Gauntlet keybinds need a jump point or a list of switchers to work properly. You can customize both of these settings as well in your Gauntlet settings.
